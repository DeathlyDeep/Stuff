Typoglycemier, a typoglicemic scribe.

This program writes to stdout the text entered on stdin, taking each word and
shuffling their characters except for the first and last character of each
word. Because of typoglicemia, the text is still readable with a bit of
effort. This effect can be used to dissimulate a piece of text from a robot
and make for a basic captcha, or make sure a text can only be read if one
wants to and help dissimulate spoilers about films or video games where
discussion forums does not provide more efficient dissimulation methods.

A word is considered to be a suite of letters from A to Z regardless of case.
Incidentally, accented characters and most Unicode characters that one could
use to make a legit word will not count as word components, and will instead
act as word separators.
