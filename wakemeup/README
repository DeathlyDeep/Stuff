This program takes a date as defined by the `date` utility as arguments and
(tries to) wake you up at that time by making annoying noises with your
motherboard’s buzzer. It will tell you if you give it a date in the past, and
displays the date at which it will wake you up and the remaining time before
then so that you can control if it’s good.
